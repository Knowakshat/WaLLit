# WaLLit
WaLLit is a Wallpaper generating web app built with Javascript, HTML &amp; CSS which generates a new wallpaper each time you click on the "Generate Wallpaper" button. But what's the catch? Each time you generate a new wallpaper, you get a new English word and it's meaning with it helping you get better with your vocabulary.
